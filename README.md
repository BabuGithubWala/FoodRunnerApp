📱 Check out my latest project: The Food Runner App! 🍔🍕🍟

🚀 I'm excited to share that I've created a powerful app that simplifies food ordering. With features like Login, Registration, and a convenient Forgot Password button, it's user-friendly and secure! 🔐

💡 The app's sleek layout showcases an extensive Food Menu List, making ordering your favorite dishes a breeze! 😋

⏰ Developing this app was an incredible journey, investing 5-7 hours of hard work and dedication. Along the way, I tackled numerous challenges and resolved pesky errors. But the end result was worth it! 🎉

💻 Built using a combination of XML and Kotlin, the app is both efficient and robust. 💪
